# Lucidchart Simulation Extension Overview

## Introduction
This project implements a simulation modeling extension for Lucidchart, enabling users to create and edit process flow diagrams with simulation capabilities. The extension integrates seamlessly with Lucidchart while providing powerful simulation modeling features.

## Core Architecture
- Built as a Lucidchart extension using their SDK
- Uses React for the UI components 
- Implements both a right panel and modal editors for different simulation objects

## Main Simulation Components

### Activities
- Process steps with configurable parameters
- Includes capacity settings
- Buffer management
- Operation step definition

### Connectors 
- Links between activities
- Probability-based routing
- Connection type configuration

### Entities
- Objects that flow through the system
- Custom attribute support
- Type definitions

### Resources
- Required for activities to operate
- Capacity management
- Resource pooling

### Generators
- Create entities dynamically
- Configurable generation patterns
- Timing and quantity controls

### Models
- Container for the entire simulation
- Runtime parameters
- Simulation configuration

## Key Features

### Visual Editing
- Direct integration with Lucidchart's interface
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Visual flow creation

### Property Management
- Dedicated editors for each object type
- Form-based configuration
- Real-time updates

### Model Operations
- Validation capabilities
- Model conversion tools
- Simulation execution
- Status monitoring

### Component Management
- Type switching support
- Persistent data storage
- State management

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- TypeScript throughout
- Clean separation between UI and data layers
- Message passing system
- Persistent storage integration
- Standardized editor components

### User Interface
- Multi-tab interface for model properties
- Form-based editors
- Real-time status monitoring
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Dual interface support (right panel/modal)

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive type safety
- Error handling
- State management
- Resource cleanup

## Best Practices
- Clean architecture principles
- Separation of concerns
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Component reusability
- Code maintainability

This implementation represents a professional-grade simulation modeling tool that successfully balances functionality, usability, and maintainability while providing seamless integration with the Lucidchart platform.
