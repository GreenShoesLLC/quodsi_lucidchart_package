Validation requirements for ModelPanelAccordion:

Timing of Validation:

Validation should occur during initial model loading when the extension starts up
Validation should run when a user selects different model elements
Validation should run when model elements are modified
Validation should run when explicitly requested (e.g. validate button)


Data Flow:

Validation occurs in the quodsi_editor_extension project using ModelValidationService
ValidationResults should be included in the SELECTION_CHANGED messages rather than separate VALIDATION_RESULT messages to prevent UI flicker
Only use separate VALIDATION_RESULT messages for explicit validation requests


UI Requirements:

Validation results appear in ModelPanelAccordion as an accordion section alongside ModelTreeSection and ElementEditor
The validation section should show:

Total error count
Total warning count
List of validation messages
Messages can be filtered to show only those relevant to the currently selected element




Integration Points:

ModelManager needs to validate the ModelDefinition
ModelPanel needs to include validation results in its selection change messages
ValidationMessages component displays the results in the accordion UI
Message types in shared project need to support validation data



Based on the requirements, here are the necessary changes:

Shared Project Changes:

Update MessageTypes.ts to include ValidationResult in the SELECTION_CHANGED payload type

Extension Project Changes (quodsi_editor_extension):

Update ModelManager.validateModel() to ensure it runs during initialization
Modify ModelPanel.handleSelectionChange() to include validation results in SELECTION_CHANGED messages
Review validation message triggering in ModelManager when elements are modified

React Project Changes (quodsim-react):
No structural changes needed since:

ModelPanelAccordion already handles the validation accordion section
ValidationMessages component exists and handles display
ValidationMessageList component exists for message rendering

The key focus should be on ensuring proper validation state flow through existing messaging architecture by:

Running validation at the right times in the extension
Including validation results in selection messages
Maintaining existing UI components that already handle validation display
