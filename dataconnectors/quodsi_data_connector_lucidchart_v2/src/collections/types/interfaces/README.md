# Simulation Data Interfaces

This directory contains TypeScript interfaces for various simulation data types used in the Quodsi data connector.

## Purpose

These interfaces define the structure of data that is:
1. Retrieved from CSV files generated by the simulation engine
2. Processed by the data connector
3. Sent to LucidChart for display

Each interface is in its own file for better organization, maintainability, and readability.

## Available Interfaces

| Interface File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ActivityUtilizationData.ts` | Activity utilization metrics including mean/max/std dev values |
| `ActivityRepSummaryData.ts` | Summarized metrics for activities across simulation replications |
| `ActivityTimingData.ts` | Timing-related metrics for activities (durations, delays, etc.) |
| `EntityStateRepSummaryData.ts` | Entity state metrics across simulation replications |
| `EntityThroughputRepSummaryData.ts` | Entity throughput metrics across replications |
| `ResourceRepSummaryData.ts` | Resource utilization and capacity metrics |
| `CompleteActivityMetricsData.ts` | Comprehensive set of activity metrics |
| `CustomMetricsData.ts` | User-defined custom metrics from simulation outputs |

## Usage

You can import these interfaces either directly from their individual files:

```typescript
import { EntityStateRepSummaryData } from '../collections/types/interfaces/EntityStateRepSummaryData';
```

Or through the interfaces index file:

```typescript
import { EntityStateRepSummaryData } from '../collections/types/interfaces';
```

Or through the main simulationTypes.ts file for backward compatibility:

```typescript
import { EntityStateRepSummaryData } from '../collections/types/simulationTypes';
```

## Adding New Interfaces

When adding new simulation data types:

1. Create a new file in this directory named after the data type (e.g., `NewMetricsData.ts`)
2. Define the interface with appropriate JSDoc comments
3. Add the interface to the exports in `index.ts`
4. Update the main `simulationTypes.ts` file if necessary
