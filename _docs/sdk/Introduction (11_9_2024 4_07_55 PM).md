 Introduction















Welcome to the Lucid developer platform! Lucid provides powerful APIs that enable developers to add the power of visual collaboration to their product or workflow. This section serves as an introduction to what's possible and how to start building.
Use cases
Developers can build multiple kinds of apps on our platform. Below are examples of how you can use our APIs:

External embed of Lucid documents Display diagrams and whiteboards created with Lucid in other websites.
On-canvas link unfurl Visualize content from other platforms within Lucid products.
Task management cards Provide a way to visually create and track tasks across the entire project workflow.
Shape libraries Distribute custom icons and shapes across an organization or globally on the Lucid marketplace.
Data import/syncing Update Lucid diagrams with data from outside sources and make changes to data sources directly from Lucid documents.

APIs
Lucid offers three sets of APIs:

Lucid's REST API allows developers to programmatically interact with ( create, search, read contents of, trash, etc.) documents and folders.
This API also provides endpoints for embedding documents, adding/removing collaborators, transferring content between users, and more.
Lucid's Extension API allows developers to add functionality to Lucid editors. This API can import data, add/read/modify shapes and lines on the canvas, and define new shape libraries for internal or public distribution.
Lucid's SCIM API offers user provisioning and group management, available for admins on an Enterprise account.

Start building
Building on the developer platform requires access to developer tools.
To get access, read Unlocking developer tools.
To start building on the REST API, go to the API key creation guide to obtain an API key, then visit Using API Keys to begin making API requests. For developers more experienced with OAuth 2.0, see our OAuth 2.0 client creation guide for help creating a client, then visit the Using OAuth 2.0 section in our REST API technical documentation to create an access token needed for API requests.
To start building on the Extension API, see Getting started in our Extension API technical documentation. For examples of extensions built on the Extension API, see Lucid's public GitHub repository.
To start building on the SCIM API, see our SCIM technical documentation.

Lucid's FedRAMP environment
Users in the FedRAMP environment should follow the links below for accessing developer support and requesting features. Users accessing the community from Lucid's FedRAMP environment will be able to view community posts, but will not be able to edit or comment,

If you have questions or need support, please select "FedRAMP Environment" on this form.
Please submit FedRAMP environment feedback and feature requests through this form.

Applications developed in the FedRAMP environment can be privately published, but will not be eligible to publicly publish on the Lucid marketplace. Follow this guide for publishing privately.
Developing on the REST API in the FedRAMP environment is an altered experience and uses different routes. See details here.
Developing on the Extension API does not change in the FedRAMP environment.
