# LucidChart Data Storage Strategy Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for mapping between LucidChart's diagram elements and Quodsi's simulation model components. The strategy must leverage LucidChart's native shape data storage capabilities to create and maintain a persistent, valid simulation model.

## Conceptual Mapping Requirements

### Core Mapping Structure
```
LucidChart                 Quodsi
---------                 -------
Page         ------>      ModelDefinition
Shapes       ------>      Activities, Resources, Entities, Generators
Lines        ------>      Connectors
```

### Storage Requirements

1. **Page Level Storage**
   - Must store model-wide configuration
   - Must maintain simulation status information
   - Must preserve page-level metadata
   - Must persist model validation state

2. **Block Level Storage (Shapes)**
   - Must store activity definitions
   - Must maintain resource configurations
   - Must preserve entity definitions
   - Must store generator settings
   - Must maintain configuration state for each simulation object type

3. **Line Level Storage (Connectors)**
   - Must store routing probabilities
   - Must maintain transition rules
   - Must preserve flow configurations
   - Must store connection validation state

## Model Validation Requirements

### Valid Model Definition
A valid Quodsi simulation model must meet these minimum requirements:
1. Must contain at least one valid Activity
2. Must contain at least one valid Generator
3. Must contain valid Connector(s) between Activities

### Generator Requirements
Each Generator in the model must:
- Have a valid activityKeyId reference
- Reference an existing Activity in the model
- Reference a properly mapped and configured Activity
- Maintain valid generator-specific configuration

### Connector Requirements
Each Connector in the model must:
- Be mapped to a valid Line in the diagram
- Have valid source and destination Activities
- Connect to properly mapped Activity shapes
- Maintain valid probability or routing rules

### Activity Requirements
Each Activity in the model must:
- Have a unique identifier
- Have a valid name
- Maintain required capacity settings
- Define valid operation steps if required
- Specify valid resource requirements if needed

## Data Management Requirements

### Persistence Requirements
- Must survive document saves and loads
- Must maintain simulation state
- Must preserve all configuration settings
- Must handle version control of stored data

### Type Safety Requirements
- Must enforce strong typing for all stored data

- Must optimize serialization/deserialization
- Must handle large model configurations

## Model Operations Requirements

### Conversion Requirements
- Must support conversion from standard LucidChart pages to simulation models
- Must validate all components during conversion
- Must maintain data integrity during conversion
- Must provide clear error reporting for invalid conversions

### Validation Requirements
- Must validate model completeness
- Must verify all references between components
- Must ensure all required properties are present
- Must maintain validation state
- Must provide detailed validation reporting

### Cleanup Requirements
- Must support complete model removal
- Must clean up all stored data
- Must restore original diagram state
- Must handle partial cleanup for invalid states

## Integration Requirements

### LucidChart Integration
- Must use native LucidChart storage APIs

- Must support natural workflow
- Must handle errors gracefully
- Must provide clear status information

### Extensibility
- Must support addition of new object types
- Must allow for data structure evolution
- Must support versioning of stored formats
- Must handle backward compatibility

## Error Handling Requirements

### Data Validation
- Must validate all data before storage
- Must implement comprehensive type checking
- Must handle malformed data recovery
- Must maintain system stability
- Must provide clear error reporting

### Recovery Operations

### System Stability
- Must prevent cascading failures
- Must maintain diagram usability during errors
- Must preserve existing valid data
- Must support graceful degradation

## Maintenance Requirements

### Data Structure Management
- Must document all data structures
