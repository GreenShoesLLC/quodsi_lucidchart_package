# Product or Service Description & Problem it Solves

Many organizations use Business Process Models (BPMs) or Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) to analyze and improve processes by reducing waste, increasing efficiency, or boosting throughput. However, these tools are inherently static, showing only the structure of a process and not its performance over time—key insights needed to test changes, assess risk, and maximize ROI.

Today, most companies rely on two separate tools for process improvement:
1. **Process Mapping Tools** (e.g., LucidChart, Miro) for structure.
2. **Data Analytics Tools** (e.g., Excel) to evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) like throughput, resource utilization, and costs.

Unfortunately, spreadsheets struggle to model complex systems with dynamic interdependencies and randomness. This is where **discrete event simulation (DES)** shines—providing a robust, time-based approach to performance analysis.

**Quodsi LLC** is developing a solution that converts static process diagrams into simulation models, allowing users to:
- Test various "what-if" scenarios.
- Maximize efficiency and ROI.
- Mitigate risks in complex systems.

Our platform integrates with existing process tools, like LucidChart, to eliminate redundant diagramming and reduce the steep learning curve traditionally associated with simulation technology.

# Competitive Advantage

While process mapping and diagramming are industry-standard, tools like LucidChart, Miro, and Draw.io focus solely on static documentation. These are not competitors but instead strategic partners for integration and sales channels.

Established simulation tools exist, but they:
- Require significant technical expertise.
- Are costly with annual enterprise licensing fees.
- Cater to large-scale, complex models.

In contrast, **Quodsi** targets users who need simple, intuitive simulations. By embedding our solution directly into familiar process tools, we offer:
- **Ease of Use:** No need for extensive training.
- **Efficiency:** Seamless integration with existing diagrams.
- **Accessibility:** A lower-cost, scalable SaaS model.

This focus on simplicity, integration, and accessibility provides a sustainable competitive edge.

# Technology Platform

Quodsi is built on a modern, scalable technology stack that integrates visual process modeling with discrete event simulation. Our architecture includes:

1. **LucidChart Extension:** Built with TypeScript/JavaScript for visual modeling.
2. **React-based UI:** A user-friendly interface for managing simulations.
3. **Python Simulation Engine:** Handles core simulation logic.
4. **.NET Web API Backend:** Supports enterprise integration and data management.

We have designed the platform with future integrations in mind, allowing expansion to other process tools like Miro and Draw.io. The core innovation lies in the **translation layer** that converts visual diagrams into executable simulation models.

While no patents are currently held, our unique approach may offer opportunities for IP protection.

# Business Model

Quodsi will follow a **product-led growth** strategy. We will offer a **free LucidChart extension** that allows users to:
- Convert diagrams into simulations.
- Build simulations using a predefined object library.

Users can run small simulations for free to demonstrate the platform’s value. We will then convert users to paying subscribers through usage-based pricing. Our model aligns with Microsoft's Azure cloud costs, which include both storage and processing hours.

We plan to offer tiered subscription packages that scale based on:
1. **Processing Power:** Time allocated for running simulations.
2. **Storage:** Number of models and simulation histories stored.

We will leverage **LucidChart’s existing customer base** and marketing channels to drive adoption. Future integrations with other tools will follow a similar partnership strategy.

# Financial Plan

To date, Quodsi has not received external funding. Our development efforts are sustained by:
- **Microsoft Founders Program:** Providing free Azure credits for cloud infrastructure.
- **Bootstrapping:** Limited investment from personal funds for administrative expenses.

We plan to seek additional funding after the launch of version 1.0 to scale operations and marketing efforts.
